# Loan Repayments using Excel
- This report contains data from a trial conducted on farmers loan repayments across three districts namely lugari, chwele, and bungoma. The trials were from an experiment regarding the adoption of a new strategy requiring farmers to pay about 10% of their total transaction within the first year should be scaled up or not. The 2019 data was before the experiment while 2020 was after the experiment. 
- I conducted an analysis to check on the impact the trial experiment had on % qualification of loans, % loan repayment, and % default rate.
- From the analysis, greatest impact on qualification was from Chwele (4.7% decrease), greatest impact on repayment rate was on Chwele and Bungoma regions (decrease of 5.1% and 5.6% respectively), and greatest impact on default rate was on Chwele and Bungoma regions (increase of 5.1% and 5.6%).
- Further analysis of the loans spread at Chwele and Bungoma shows that most loans taken are below Kes. 25,000.
# Conclusions
  1. The 10% repayment was successful in Lugari region, since the qualification, default, and repayment rates have remained unchanged. Lugari should be carefully studied to see the features of farmers in the district and used to understand why the strategy was greatly adopted. 
  2. The strategy affects the number of farmers who are qualified for the adoption of the loans in Chwele district.
  3. The strategy also affects default & loan repayment rates in Chwele and Bungoma districts.
  4. Therefore, further research especially behavioral on the farmers is needed to understand more insights on how to make the strategy successful and efficient in Chwele and Bungoma as is the case in Lugari district.
  5. The study should be specific on the farmers taking loans below Kes. 25,000.
